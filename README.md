Targeting Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2 for Parkinson's Disease Treatment

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Emerging research suggests that the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2 (M2 mAChR), a protein abundantly expressed in the human brain, could be a potential therapeutic target for PD. In this study, we aimed to identify and evaluate a diverse set of ligands targeting M2 mAChR, abstracted from the Chembl database, at their IC50 concentrations, with the goal of alleviating PD symptoms.

Methods:

Data Collection: We curated a dataset of ligands targeting M2 mAChR from the Chembl database, ensuring a wide range of chemical structures and IC50 concentrations.

Ligand Selection: Ligands were selected based on their IC50 concentrations, ensuring a representative sample covering a spectrum of binding affinities to M2 mAChR.

Drug-Like Candidacy Screening: All selected ligands were evaluated against Lipinski's Rule of 5 to assess their drug-like properties, ensuring they have the potential for oral bioavailability and suitability for further drug development.

Statistical Analysis: We performed a Mann-Whitney U Test using Lipinski descriptors to assess the null hypothesis, determining if there were significant differences in physicochemical properties between ligands that adhere to Lipinski's Rule of 5 and those that do not.

Results:

Diverse Ligand Set: A diverse set of ligands targeting M2 mAChR, abstracted from Chembl, was identified, representing a wide range of IC50 concentrations.

Drug-Like Candidates: Ligands adhering to Lipinski's Rule of 5 were identified, indicating their potential as drug candidates for further research and development.

Statistical Insights: Mann-Whitney U Test results provided statistical evidence supporting the differences in physicochemical properties between ligands adhering to Lipinski's Rule of 5 and those that do not, allowing for a better understanding of the ligand characteristics influencing drug-likeness.

Conclusion:

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of ligands targeting M2 mAChR, abstracted from the Chembl database, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. By focusing on ligands adhering to Lipinski's Rule of 5, we have identified potential drug candidates with favorable physicochemical properties. The statistical analysis conducted using Mann-Whitney U Test offers valuable insights into the relationship between specific descriptors and drug-likeness. These findings provide a solid foundation for further in-depth studies and drug development efforts aimed at alleviating Parkinson's disease symptoms through targeted modulation of M2 mAChR.
